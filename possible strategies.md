1. Retroengineer winning strategies from successful traders on Polymarket (careful: some may perform arbitrage and have hidden losses on other betting websites).

2. Stupid strategies like always betting on the likely outcome on politics markets.

3. Discrepancy on memoryless markets (example: war ends in 10 days = 80%, war ends in 30 days = 90%; if this market is supposed to be memoryless then there is a discrepancy—I have the exact formula for the optimal agnostic bet).

4. Tristan's strategy: all markets with expiry dates such that 3 < ed < 7 and that open between 45% and 55% have a 63% chance to resolve to **NO**.
